# Gene Expression Model
This section of modelling is concerned with linking output quantities of enzymes with the input concentration of the inducer IPTG, by considering:
* The rate of production of mRNA from DNA
* The mRNA degradation rate
* The transcription rate
* The maturation rate of each enzyme
* The degradation rate of each enzyme
